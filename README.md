1. Toss a fair coin twice. Youwin$2 if both tosses comes out heads,lose$1 if no toss comesout heads, and win or lose nothing otherwise

2. Assume that you play this game 500 times. What is, approximately, the probabilitythat you win at least $135?

3. A couple decides to have 4 children. If they succeed in having 4 children and each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, what is the probability that they will have exactly 2 girls and 2 boys?

4.Toss three fair coins. What is the probabitly of exactly one H?

5. Roll a die 4 times. What is the probability that you get different numbers?

6. You walk along a line, each pace being the same length.

7. 
Before each step, you flip a coin.

If it’s heads, you take one step forward.  If it’s tails, you take one step back. 

The coin is unbiased, so the chances of heads or tails are equal.

The problem is to find the probability of landing at a given spot after a given number of steps, and, in particular, to find how far away you are on average from where you started.

8. In the tent next to you there is a family with two children. Early in the morning you see a boy coming out of the tent. What is the probability that the other child is a girl?
